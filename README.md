# Anywhere To GitHub Activity Tracker

Because GitHub activity is considered important for some people in the programming industry, I wanted to make sure that my efforts at McLeod are not untracked.

This script is just an extra layer added to the `git push` command. And now, every time a new commit is pushed to the private McLeod repository, a second commit is pushed here, honestly and effortlessly tracking my activity. Of course, it also allows for all the `git push` arguments. I wanted this to be as similar to the normal git workflow as possible.

To run, ensure the `\bin` folder is added to your environment variable Path. Ensure Python 3 is installed, and added to Path. 

Once this is done, you can run `gitpush` everywhere you'd normally use `git push`.
